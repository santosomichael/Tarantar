# Tarantar  
## Inspiration  

When we were chatting together, our discussion shifted to stories of our friends and relatives who opened small businesses (SMEs) or became couriers during this time of COVID-19. Their story was the beginning of our inspiration to create this Tarantar application.

We hear stories of friends and relatives who opened an SME and needed to find couriers to deliver their goods thorough the city. At the same time, we also know friends and relatives who have recently became couriers due to the economy, but they have difficulties finding people who want to ship their goods too. It is a story that many of us know, and we found ourselves wanting to do something when we talked with each other. That is how we work together to create the Tarantar app.

## What it does  

Through Tarantar, we want to help create jobs by connecting shippers (especially small businesses), couriers looking for goods to deliver, and recipients, as our contribution in this difficult time of Indonesia's economy.

## How we built it  

In making applications and participating in this hackathon, we are a team of 4 people where we shared the tasks of creating a Flutter Tarantar application demo, application design, video creation, and other matters related to this hackathon. We communicated through chat applications, Google Meet, and stayed up late together to produce the Flutter Tarantar application. Almost every day there would be a progress recording of our Flutter app that we could see to keep us excited.

## Challenges we ran into  

Finding a way to tackle problem based on courier and small medium business’ perspective. How to treat them better during this time of COVID-19. Learning new tools and technologies as we build.

## Accomplishment that we’re proud of  

Knowing that our application would be useful for many people and making an impact for others.

## What we learned  

Technology can help us solve many problems around us. It only takes courage and awareness of our surroundings to contribute our parts, too.

## What's next for Tarantar  

Solving more and making a better solution for others.
